# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
*Version control is security of having the history of incremental revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by others. This is very useful because should something go wrong while developing code for a projecct, there is always a saftey net of going to back to a version that worked and then taking it from there.*

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
*Branches are edits and additions to what would be considered a master file that don't directly effect the master file until it's merged with it. Branches are useful because when working on a team to develop a project, certain aspects of the project can be distributed and worked on simultaneously without stepping on eachothers toes. It's also good to organize a solo project.*

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
*A commit is the acception and implementation of a change made in a git repo. A good commit message makes it clear for whomever else is looking at the changes what exactly was changed.*

* What is a merge conflict?
*A merge conflict is when a branch cannot be merged with another branch because of conflicting information between the branch itself and where it's being merged.* More information on Merge Conflict and how to deal with them [Here.](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/advanced-topics/merge-conflicts)
