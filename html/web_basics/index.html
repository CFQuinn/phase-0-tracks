		<h2>Puppies</h2>
			<p>I almost got a puppy today, <strong>BUT</strong> then I thought about <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Adulting"><em>adulting.</em></a> I came up with reasons why I shouldn't get the puppy</p>
				<ol>
					<li>I'm broke</li>
						<ul>
							<li>I can barely feed myself</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Wouldn't be home enough to train and spen time with him/her</li>
						<ul>
							<li>I have a full time job</li>
						</ul>
				</ol>
			<p>All that said... I still got the puppy. JK, I didn't get the puppy. :(</p>
