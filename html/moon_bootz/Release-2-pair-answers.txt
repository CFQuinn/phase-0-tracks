1. What is a block-level element? What are some examples of block-level elements? What are they used for? 

	Block level elements are elements that take up an entire row of space on a webpage. Some examples are paragraph (<p>), footers (<footer>), Nav (<nav>). Block levels are used to add samantic value.

2. Can you find any good charts or resources on when you should use these elements? For example, when might you use a div versus a section?
	
	You'd want to use "div" for styling, and "section" identifying samantic value of content.

3. What is an inline element?

	Inline elements are primarily for styling and do not take an entire row of a web page like a block element does, and are the beginning and end of an elements influence. i.e. you'd never nest a block element inside a inline element.

4. Do inline elements usually nest inside block-level elements, or is it typically the other way around?

	Inline elements do usally nest inside block-level elements because block level gives the samantic value while inline gives the style value.
